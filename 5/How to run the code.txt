The program takes input 'n' as the number of terms in each polynomial.
'n' is declared as a global variable and is assigned values to do the empirical study.

Enter the value of 'n' as you like to multiply two polynomials each of size 'n' having randomized double coefficents within the range [-1,1].

Output: The product polynomial.
